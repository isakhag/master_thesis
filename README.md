Collection of scripts and excel files I have used in my thesis. The excel sheets are created with the scripts, and then reused for other purposes. 
The entire study area was divided into 10m x 10m pixels and stored as a parquet file called "study_area.parquet". Unfortunately the file is too large to be put here on GitHub. This file was therefore uploaded on Inspera Assessment in a zip-file. 
All .tif-files (which also are quite large) was additionally added to Inspera Assessment. The .tif-files from SR16R was not added since they can be collected from NIBIO. Those files are for instance called: "sr16_34_SRRBMU, sr16_34_SRRTRESLAG" etc..
